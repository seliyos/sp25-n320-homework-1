# Assignment: Understanding Key Development Topics

## Full-Stack Web Development

Full-stack web development is creating and managing both the front-end and back-end of a web application. It includes working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or other languages for back-end. Full-stack developers can manage the entire development process, ensuring functionality and design are integrated.

## Node.js Understanding

Node.js is a tool that lets you use JavaScript to do things on a computer or server, not just inside a web browser. Normally, JavaScript works only in browsers like Chrome or Safari, but Node.js lets it work anywhere, even on servers. Node.js is built using the same runtime that powers the Google Chrome browser, so it's fast and reliable.

## Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version control systems, like Git, helps to keep track of changes to a code and work as a team on projects. With Git, team members can work on their own parts of the project and easily combine their changes later. GitHub is a website where these projects can be stored, shared, and managed.

## Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a way to format text for things like documentation. It helps developers create neat and organized documents using plain text. In software development, Markdown is usually used in README.md files to explain what a project is about, how to set it up, and how to use it. Writing clear and simple documentation is important for teamwork and keeping projects easy to understand.
